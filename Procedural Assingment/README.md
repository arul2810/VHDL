# COMPARATOR 8 - BIT - Procedural Assignment

Contains VHDL Project Files.

Complied using Quartus Prime Lite 17 for 5CSEMA5F31C6 

8 - Bit Comparator. 

Logic :

Contains two 8-Bit Variables 'a' and  'b'.

If 'a' is greater than 'b' then the value of wire a_high would be 1.
If 'b' is greater than 'a' then the value of wire b_high would be 1.
If 'a' is equal to 'b' then the value of wire equal would be 1.
